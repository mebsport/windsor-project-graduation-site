        Project Graduation is an annual event that is exclusively organized for
        the graduating seniors of Windsor High School. The event is aimed at
        providing a safe, drug-free, and fun-filled environment for the seniors
        to celebrate their graduation with their friends. The event is entirely
        managed and organized by parent volunteers, who put in a year-long
        effort to raise funds and plan for the event.

        The night is full of entertaining activities, including music and
        dancing with a live DJ, delicious food, fun games, and exciting prizes.
        The main objective of Project Graduation is to offer the seniors a
        chance to celebrate their graduation in a secure and comfortable
        environment, away from the potential dangers of drugs and alcohol.

        This event is made possible through the generous donations of the
        community members who believe in the importance of providing a safe and
        memorable graduation experience for the seniors. The party starts at 11
        PM and ends at 3 AM, and all the seniors are guaranteed to have a great
        time, create everlasting memories, and stay safe throughout the night.
