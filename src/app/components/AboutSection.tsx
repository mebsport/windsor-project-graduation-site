        Project Graduation is an annual event that is exclusively organized for
        the graduating seniors of Windsor High School. The event is aimed at
        providing a safe, drug-free, and fun-filled environment for the seniors
        to celebrate their graduation with their friends. The event is entirely
        managed and organized by parent volunteers, who put in a year-long
        effort to raise funds and plan for the event.
